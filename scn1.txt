SCENE 1 
[Stepan's well-off livingroom, early afternoon, he's dressed formally and ready to leave, he faces the audience and begins speaking in a haughty and defiant tone possibly adjusting his clothes]

STEPAN:
Can you suppose... that I, Stepan Verhovensky, cannot find the moral strength to pack a bag, lay it on these feeble shoulders and go out my gate to vanish forever?  This is not the first time I've had to repel despotism!  Especially of that crazy woman who supports me. 'Stay at home', she instructs me!  I see... you don't believe I have the strength to leave this pampered servitude to the Petrovna family and march off to die of hunger in a ditch!  Answer me! Honor demands it! Do you or don't you believe I have the strength?  Or, perhaps you are bored with me?

[Snatches hat & stick to leave when voices at the door, he stops, thunder-struck. Leputin enters followed by Krillov.]

Liputin! [to himself] I am lost....

LIPUTIN:
Good afternoon, Stepan, I hope I'm not intruding.

STEPAN:
I wasn't expecting to entertain today -

LIPUTIN:
Bah, you were going out! I was told that you were to stay at home.

STEPAN:
I meant to go for a walk, I was feeling unwell -

[Flings hat and stick on the sofa embarrased, Liputin drags a chair to the middle, eyes darting from one side to the other.]

LIPUTIN:
I've brought a visitor, Mr. Kirillov, a distinguished civil engineer. And... he has a message from your son, the much esteemed Pyotr.

[Stepan mechanically offers his hand and motioned him to sit and sits himself still with stick and hat in hand unaware]

KRILLOV:
There's no message.

STEPAN:
Oh, it's a long while since I've seen my son... You met him abroad?

KRILLOV:
Here and abroad, I left him in X. province ten days ago.

LIPUTIN: (about Krillov)
Mr. Krillov has only just returned.  He comes to our town for a job on the new railway bridge... he knows Nikolay too.

STEPAN:
You know Varvara's son as well?

KRILLOV:
[angrily] I know him.

STEPAN:
It's been... years since I've seen either of them.  You may not know, I was Nikolay's tutor. Regrettably with my own son, I have little right to call myself a father...  How is Pyotr?

KRILLOV:
You can ask him yourself soon enough.

STEPAN:
He's coming?  At last I ... it's very long since I've seen him!  The last was years ago in the Capitol, he was such a nervous boy - used to pray each night that he wouldn't die in his sleep. Comma un petit idiot....

KRILLOV:
He prayed each night you say?

[Stepan nods]

Things have changed.

STEPAN:
Where do you lodge?

KRILLOV:
Filipov's guesthouse.

STEPAN:
Ah, isn't that where our poor friend Shatov lives?

LIPUTIN:
The very same house!  Only Shatov lodges above in the attic, while Mr. Krillov is down below.

STEPAN:
I'm fond of Shatov, but the boy seems lost speaking of nationalism and -

LIPUTIN:
Our friend is making a study on the increase of suicide in the province.

KRILLOV:
I'm not making a study.

LIPUTIN:
I beg your pardon! He's collecting observations.  Mr. Krillov rejects morality altogether and holds to the principle total destruction.

KRILLOV:
I scorn this kind of superficial talk.

STEPAN:
But perhaps your ideas are wise?

KRILLOV:
For years I tried to see no one.  Liputin found out and is laughing.  I don't mind, I'm only annoyed at his liberty, maybe he wants to give information to the government.

[Silence]

STEPAN:
Gentlemen, I'm sorry but I feel unwell if you wouldn't mind - 

KRILLOV:
That's for us to go.

[Krillov rises and with a good-natured air holds out his hand.]

STEPAN:
I wish you every success among us.  I was only puzzled at one thing: you want to help build the new railway bridge yet hold to the principle of universal destruction?

KRILLOV:
The railway? I say!

[Krillov laughs.]

LIPUTIN:
The reason Krillov is so short today is because he had a problem with another lodger, Captain Lebyadkin, who thrashes his lame sister, the unfortunate mad girl, every morning and evening with a whip. Well, good-bye.

STEPAN:
An invalid being whipped?  Who is this Lebyadkin?  Not the lieutenant who lived....

LEPUTIN:
The very same man.

STEPAN:
If Leptuin's speaking the truth then he's a scoundrel.

LEPUTIN:
As though none of us could be a scoundrel.

STEPAN:
What do you say?

LEPUTIN:
I was referring only to myself.  But there's more... this mad sister of Captain Lebyadkin its seems is involved with someone from our town, someone with money, and the Captain receives a considerable sum to keep quiet about it.

KRILLOV:
You gossip too much, Leputin.

[Krillov starts to exit]

LEPUTIN:
Just this morning, our guest snatched the whip from the Captain's hand as he beat his sister -

KRILLOV:
That's enough.

LEPUTIN:
Why conceal the honourable impulses of one's soul, of your soul?

KRILLOV:
Why stir things?  Its of no use to the cause.

[Krillov starts to leave again.]

LEPUTIN:
Oh, what a pity!  Stepan, I had come to share concerns of your benefactor, Varvara she sent for me in private yesterday morning.  But as Krillov must leave, so good-bye.

[Stepan seizes Leputin by the shoulders and turns him back into the room, sits him down.]

Ok, yes, yes, she sent for me in 'complete confidentiality' to ask my opinion whether her son Nikolay is mad!

STEPAN:
You're trying to start a scandal!

LEPUTIN:
Upon my word I -

STEPAN: 
Begin!

LIPUTIN:
I thought you knew already from Ms. Petrovna herself as you're so close but I see....  Well, she asked me, 'When Nikolay was last in town four years ago, tell me  four years ago, did you notice a peculiar turn of thought?'

STEPAN:
You have... so amazed me that I don't believe you.

LIPUTIN:
'I'm not saying he is mad of course, but I noticed it myself,' she said!

STEPAN:
If she asked you to keep it in confidence, and here you're telling it-

LIPUTIN:
Absolutely in confidence! But don't lecture, look how you insist yourself!  And why... we're not strangers.

STEPAN:
I don't share that attitude. 

LIPUTIN:
So I asked Krillov, 'You knew Nikolay well in the Capitol, what do you think of his mind?' Wouldn't you know, 'Sometimes I thought there was something strange', he said. 

STEPAN:
Is that true?

KRILLOV:
You have no right to drag me into this. That was long ago and not my whole opinion.  Leave me out of this scandal!

[Liputin threw up his hands in innocence.]

LIPUTIN: 
Scandal-monger!  Why not say I'm a spy?  Even the drunk Captain Lebyadkin thinks he's mad, 'He's a subtle serpent'. His own words!  'He's very clever but perhaps he's mad.'

STEPAN:
What could make Lebyadkin an authority?

LIPUTIN: 
Mr. Krillov-

KRILLOV:
I hardly know anything!  And now I see why you got Lebyadkin drunk.

LIPUTIN:
On the contrary, Captain Lebyadkin treated me to champagne, he has money these days.  But, maybe I will make him drunk one day to find out what you're hiding from us!

[Stepan grows bewildered at the two disputants]

Krillov knows Nikolay but conceals it. And he knew Captain Lebyadkin before any of us, since six years ago in the Capitol, in that obscure epoch in the life of our town prince. Nikolay surrounded himself with a queer selection of acquaintances, including Mr. Krillov.

KRILLOV:
I warn you, Nikolay is meant to be in town before long, and he knows how to defend himself.

LIPUTIN:
Why warn me?  I am the first to say he is a man of refined intelligence.  Why, even the bagy-legged, mad Mademoiselle Lebyadkin who is thrashed daily seems not only to be a victim of of her brother but Nikolay as well.  The Captain suggested it himself.  And stop this crying about slander and spying, the whole town is ringing with it!

STEPAN:
The whole town's ringing with what?

LIPUTIN: (about Lebyadkin)
Captain Lebyadkin is shouting all over town who's sending him money, and he want's more. Stepan, even your name was mentioned.

[Krillov gets up suddenly from his chair]

KRILLOV:
This is vile!

LIPUTIN:
You yourself confirmed it.

KRILLOV:
There's been a misunderstanding.

LIPUTIN:
A mad girl mixed up with our estranged prince.  You can understand a mother's concern.  You should be concerned yourselves, it's nothing for the wealthy to cover their sins by throwing shame on others.  Four years ago as you all well know, Nikolay groped my wife in front of the whole town just after shaking my hand.

STEPAN:
Be careful, Liputin.

[Stepan grows pale but stands up]

KRILLOV:
Lebyadkin's drunk. There's been a mistake. It will all be explained.

[exit Krillov]

LIPUTIN:
What? I'm going with you!

[exit Liputin]

Varvara, you ask to much, je proclame ma liberte!  I will not cover another man's sins!  Oh, Dieu! Oh, who will comfort me?

[exit Stepan slowly with hat and stick]
