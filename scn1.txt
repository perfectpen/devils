SCENE 1 
[Stepan's regal livingroom, early afternoon, he's dressed formally but ready to leave, he faces the audience and begins speaking in a haughty, contempous, melodramatic, and defiant tone possibly adjusting his clothes]

STEPAN:
Can you suppose... that I, Stepan Verhovensky, cannot find the moral strength to pack a bag and lay it on these feeble shoulders to go out my gate and vanish forever?  This is not the first time I've had to repel despotism, especially of that crazy woman who supports me.  'Stay at home', she instructs me!  You don't believe I have the strength to leave this pampered servitude, Varvara Petronva, to leave my post as a lecturer and tutor to march off and die with nobility of hunger in a ditch!  Answer me! Do you or don't you believe I have the strength?  [beat] Perhaps you're bored with me?

[Snatches hat & stick to leave when voices at the door, he stops, thunder-struck. Leputin enters followed by Krillov.]

Liputin! [to himself] I am lost....

LIPUTIN:
Afernoon, I hope not to be intruding... I've brought a visitor.

STEPAN:
I wasn't expecting to entertain today -

LIPUTIN:
Bah, you were going out! I was told that you were to stay at home today.

STEPAN:
I've not felt well but I meant to go for a walk, I...  

[Flings hat and stick on the sofa embarrased, Liputin drags a chair to the middle, eyes darting from one side to the other.]

LIPUTIN: May I introduce Mr. Kirillov, a distinguished civil engineer. He knows your son, the much esteemed Pyotr. He even brought a message from him.

[Stepan mechanically offers his hand and motioned him to sit and sits himself still with stick and hat in hand unaware]

KRILLOV:
I know Pyotr, but there's no message.

STEPAN:
It's... a long while since I've seen Pyotr. You met abroad?

KRILLOV:
Both here and abroad.  I left him in X. province ten days ago.

LIPUTIN: (about Krillov)
Mr. Krillov has only just returned.  He has come to our town for a possible job building the new railway bridge.  He knows Varvara's son Nikolay too.

STEPAN:
You know Nicolay as well?

KRILLOV:
[angrily] I know him too.

STEPAN:
It's been... years since I've seen either Nikolay or my son Pyotr.  As Nikolay's tutor we were actually quite close.  Regrettably, I have little right to even call myself a father...  Is he doing well?

KRILLOV:
You can ask him yourself soon enough.

STEPAN:
He's coming? At last I ... you see, it's very long since I've see Pyotr!  When I left him in Capitol he was such a nervous boy, he used to pray each night, crossing his pillow, that he would not die in his sleep... comma un idiot....

KRILLOV:
He used to pray each night you say?

[Stepan nods]

Surprising.

STEPAN:
I'm grateful for this news.... Where do you lodge?

KRILLOV:
The guesthouse on the edge of town.

STEPAN:
Where Shatov lives?

LIPUTIN:
The very same house!  Only Shatov lodges above in the attic, while Mr. Krillov is down below with Captain Lebyadkin. He knows Shatov too. 

KRILLOV:
How you add to things!

STEPAN:
I only ask because I'm fond of our friend Shatov. The poor boy gave up his ideals too abruptly. Now he says religious things about saints. He seems depressed.

LIPUTIN:
Mr. Krillov is making a study on the increase of suicide in the province.

KRILLOV:
I'm not making a study. And Liputin, I asked your views, that's all.

[Liputin was obviously enjoying himself.]

LIPUTIN:
I beg your pardon! He's only collecting observations. However, he rejects morality altogether and holds with the to the principle total destruction being for the ultimate good, that it is somehow the logical conclusion we should all reach to take our own lives. 

[Krillov gives Liputin contemptuous smile, and for a minute every one was silent.]

KRILLOV:
I scorn talk this kind of talk, Liputin.

STEPAN:
But perhaps your ideas are wise.

KRILLOV:
For four years I tried to see no one. Liputin found this out and is laughing.  I don't mind, I'm only annoyed at his liberty. I'm not afraid if someone gives information to the government about me.

[Silence]

STEPAN:
Gentlemen, I'm sorry but I feel ill if you wouldn't mind excusing me.

KRILLOV:
That's for us to go. Sometimes I forget myself.

[Krillov rises and with a good-natured air holds out his hand.]

STEPAN:
I wish you every success among us.  I was only puzzled at one thing: you want to build a railway bridge yet hold to the principle of universal destruction?

KRILLOV:
The railway? I say!

[Krillov laughs and Liputin holds his hand in delight.]

LIPUTIN:
The reason Krillov is so short today is because he had a problem with his fellow lodger, Captain Lebyadkin who was thrashing the lame sister of his, the mad girl, every morning and evening with a leather whip. Well, good-bye.

STEPAN:
An invalid? Beaten with a whip?  Lebyadkin?  Who is that?  There used to be a lieutaneant....

LEPUTIN:
That's the very man.

STEPAN:
A scoundrel.

LEPUTIN:
As though none of us could be a scoundrel.

STEPAN:
What?

LEPUTIN:
I was referring only to myself. This mad sister it seems, was seduced by someone from our town. Mr. Lebyadkin receives sums of money from the seducer every 6 months to keep quiet. 

STEPAN:
Is this true?

KRILLOV:
You gossip a lot.

[Krillov starts to exit]

LEPUTIN:
Krillov snatched the whip from Lebyadkin's hand as he beat his sister just this morning, broke it, and threw it out the window.

KRILLOV:
Stop chattering!

LEPUTIN:
Why conceal the generous impulses of one's soul, of your soul?

KRILLOV:
Lebyadkin's stupid and this conversation is of use to the cause.

[Krillov starts to leave again.]

LEPUTIN:
Oh, what a pity! [beat] Stepan, I had come to share a concern, your benefactor Varvara sent for me privately yesterday. But as Krillov must leave, good-bye.

[Stepan seizes Leputin by the shoulders, turned him sharply back into the room, and sat him down in a chair alarming Liputin.]

Why, yes she sent for me yesterday and asked me 'confidentially' my private opinion, whether her son Nikolay is mad!

STEPAN:
You know you only came here to start a scandal!

LEPUTIN:
Upon my word I -

STEPAN: 
Begin!

LIPUTIN:
I thought you knew about it already from Ms. Petrovna herself.

STEPAN:
You didn't think that. Now speak!

LEPUTIN:
'Nikolay has suffered many changes of fortune in his life', she said, 'it might well have affected his state of his mind.  Four years ago when Nikolay was in town, tell me what you thought of him.  I'm saying he's mad,' she said, 'that's quite out of the question!' But there might have been a peculiar turn of thought.'

STEPAN:
You have... so amazed me that I don't believe you.

LIPUTIN:
Observe, observe...  'I noticed it myself,' she said, and then added, 'Give me your word you'll hold this in confidence and I wil take every opportuity to show my gratitude.'

STEPAN:
I haven't seen her for some days so don't know, but if it was said to you in confidence, and here you're telling it-

LIPUTIN:
Absolutely in confidence! But God strike me dead, are we strangers? Even Krillov.

STEPAN:
I don't share that attitude. 

LIPUTIN:
But given Varvara's concern I asked Krillov: 'You knew Nikolay well in the Capitol,' said I, 'What do you think of his mind?' He scowled just as he's doing now but finally admitted, 'I've sometimes thought there was something strange.' 

STEPAN:
Is that true?

KRILLOV:
I did not give my whole opinion! And you have no right to drag me into this. Yes I knew Nikolay in the Captiol but that was long ago.  Leave me out of this scandal you're brewing!

[Liputin threw up his hands with an air of oppressed innocence.]

LIPUTIN: 
Scandal-monger! Why not say a spy?  It's all well to criticise... but even Captain Lebyadkin said the same of Nikolay. 'He's a subtle serpent', he said, 'he may be clever but he's mad.'

STEPAN:
But how would Lebyadkin know?

LIPUTIN: 
Mr. Krillov?

KRILLOV:
I hardly know anything! You made Lebyadkin drunk for information. And now its clear why you brought me here, to make me say he's mad.  Like a spy.

LIPUTIN:
On the contrary, Lebyadkin treated me to champagne.  But thank you for the idea, maybe I will make him drunk one day to find out these little secrets you're hiding!

[Stepan Trofimovitch looked in bewilderment at the two disputants who were giving themselves away]

Krillov knows Nikolay but conceals it. And he knew Captain Lebyadkin before any of us, since six years ago in the Capitol, in that obscure epoch in the life of Nikolay. Our prince, it seems, surrounded himself with a queer selection of acquaintances, including Mr. Krillov.

KRILLOV:
I warn you, Nikolay is meant to be here soon, and he knows how to defend himself.

LIPUTIN:
Why warn me?  I am the first to say he is a man of refined intelligence. But I've swallowed a personal insult from his excellency myself,  s you know he made a pass at my wife in front of the town.  Why, even this lame Mademoiselle Lebyadkin who is thrashed daily with a whip, mad and bandy-legged, could be a victim of Nicolay.  Captain Lebyadkin even suggested that idea himself.  And stop crying about slander and spying but at the same time, Stepan, wringing it out of me with such curiosity. You speak of slander, the whole town is ringing with it!

STEPAN:
The whole town's ringing with what?

LIPUTIN: (about Lebyadkin)
Captain Lebyadkin is shouting it all over town and there's more, he says that Nicolay sent him one thousand rouples!

[Krillov gets up suddenly from his chair]

KRILLOV:
This is vile!

LIPUTIN:
It was you yourself who confirmed it.

KRILLOV:
There's been a misunderstanding, some one made a mistake... 

LIPUTIN:
A mad girl mixed up with the aristocratic prince Nickolay. You can see why Varvara is so concerned.  For that matter we should be too, it would mean nothing to him to disgrace to to cover his own sins by throwing shame on us, as I know myself.

STEPAN:
Be careful, Liputin.

[stepan Trofimovitch got up from his easy chair and turned pale]

KRILLOV:
Don't believe it! Somebody made a mistake and Lebyadkin's drunk.  It will all be explained.

[exit Krillov]

LIPUTIN:
What? Why, I'm going with you!

[exit Liputin]

[exit Stepan slowly with hat and stick]
