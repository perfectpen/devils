SCENE 1 
[Stepan's well-off livingroom, early afternoon, he's dressed formally and ready to leave, he faces the audience and begins speaking in a haughty and defiant tone possibly adjusting his clothes]

STEPAN:
Can you suppose... that I, Stepan Verhovensky, cannot find the moral strength to pack a bag, lay it on these feeble shoulders and go out my gate to vanish forever?  This is not the first time I've had to repel despotism, especially of that crazy woman who supports me. 'Stay at home', she instructs me!  You don't believe I have the strength to leave this pampered servitude as a tutor of the Petrovna family to march off and die of hunger, with honor, in a ditch!  Answer me! Do you or don't you believe I have the strength?  Perhaps you're bored with me?

[Snatches hat & stick to leave when voices at the door, he stops, thunder-struck. Leputin enters followed by Krillov.]

Liputin! [to himself] I am lost....

LIPUTIN:
Good afternoon, Stepan, I hope I'm not intruding.

STEPAN:
I wasn't expecting to entertain today -

LIPUTIN:
Bah, you were going out! I was told that you were to stay at home.

STEPAN:
I meant to go for a walk...  

[Flings hat and stick on the sofa embarrased, Liputin drags a chair to the middle, eyes darting from one side to the other.]

LIPUTIN: May I introduce Mr. Kirillov, a distinguished civil engineer. He's brought a message from your son, the much esteemed Pyotr.

[Stepan mechanically offers his hand and motioned him to sit and sits himself still with stick and hat in hand unaware]

KRILLOV:
There's no message.

STEPAN:
Oh, it's a long while since... You met him abroad?

KRILLOV:
I left him in X. province ten days ago.

LIPUTIN: (about Krillov)
Mr. Krillov has only just returned.  He comes to our town for a job on the new railway bridge.  He knows Nikolay too.

STEPAN:
You know Varvara's son as well?

KRILLOV:
[angrily] I know him.

STEPAN:
It's been... years since I've seen Nikolay or my son.  I was Nikolay's tutor.  Regrettably with Pyotr, I have little right to call myself a father...  How is he?

KRILLOV:
You can ask him yourself soon enough.

STEPAN:
He's coming? At last I ... it's very long since I've seen Pyotr!  The last time I saw him in Capitol he was such a nervous boy, he used to pray each night that he wouldn't die in his sleep. comma un idiot....

KRILLOV:
He prayed each night you say?

[Stepan nods]

Some things have changed.

STEPAN:
Where do you lodge?

KRILLOV:
Filipov's guesthouse.

STEPAN:
Ah, where Shatov stays?

LIPUTIN:
The very same house!  Only Shatov lodges above in the attic, while Mr. Krillov is down below.

STEPAN:
I'm fond of Shatov, but the poor boy seems depressed-

LIPUTIN:
Mr. Krillov is making a study on the increase of suicide in the province.

KRILLOV:
I'm not making a study, I only asked you your views.

LIPUTIN:
I beg your pardon! He's collecting observations. Mr. Krillov rejects morality altogether and holds to the principle total destruction.

KRILLOV:
I scorn to talk.

STEPAN:
Perhaps your ideas are wise?

KRILLOV:
For years I tried to see no one. Liputin found out and is laughing.  I don't mind, I'm only annoyed at his liberty, maybe he wants to give information to the government.

[Silence]

STEPAN:
Gentlemen, I'm sorry but I feel ill if you wouldn't mind - 

KRILLOV:
That's for us to go.

[Krillov rises and with a good-natured air holds out his hand.]

STEPAN:
I wish you every success among us.  I was only puzzled at one thing: you want to help build the new railway bridge yet hold to the principle of universal destruction?

KRILLOV:
The railway? I say!

[Krillov laughs.]

LIPUTIN:
The reason Krillov is so short today is because he had a problem with another lodger, the Captain Lebyadkin, who thrashes his lame sister, the mad girl, every morning and evening with a whip. Well, good-bye.

STEPAN:
What? An invalid? A whip? Who is Lebyadkin? There used to be a lieutenant....

LEPUTIN:
That's the very same man.

STEPAN:
If that's the truth then he's a scoundrel.

LEPUTIN:
As though none of us could be a scoundrel.

STEPAN:
What did you say?

LEPUTIN:
I was referring only to myself. But there's more about the Lebyadkins, this mad sister its seems is involved with someone with money from our town. He receives considerable money to keep quiet about it.

KRILLOV:
You gossip too much, Leputin.

[Krillov starts to exit]

LEPUTIN:
Krillov snatched the whip from Lebyadkin's hand as he beat his sister just this morning, that's why he's in a troubled mood.

KRILLOV:
Do you ever stop chattering?

LEPUTIN:
Why conceal the honourable impulses of one's soul, of your soul?

KRILLOV:
None of this is of use to the cause.

[Krillov starts to leave again.]

LEPUTIN:
Oh, what a pity! Stepan, I had come to share how this concerns your benefactor Varvara, she sent for me yesterday. But as Krillov must leave, so good-bye.

[Stepan seizes Leputin by the shoulders and turns him back into the room, sits him down.]

Yes, yes she sent for me in complete 'confidentiality' to ask my opinion whether her son Nikolay is mad!

STEPAN:
You want to start a scandal!

LEPUTIN:
Upon my word I -

STEPAN: 
Begin!

LIPUTIN:
I thought you knew already from Ms. Petrovna herself, but I see....  Well, she asked me, 'Four years ago when Nikolay was in town, tell me what you thought of him.  He's suffered many turns of fortune in his life, I'm not saying he's mad,' she said, 'that's quite out of the question! But there might have been a peculiar turn of thought.'

STEPAN:
You have... so amazed me that I don't believe you.

LIPUTIN:
'I noticed it myself,' she said!

STEPAN:
I haven't seen her for some days... but if she asked you to keep it in confidence, and here you're telling it-

LIPUTIN:
Absolutely in confidence, God strike me dead! Yet, how you insist yourself, Stepan!  But... are we strangers? Even Krillov-

STEPAN:
I don't share that attitude. 

LIPUTIN:
Well given Varvara's concern I asked Krillov, 'You knew Nikolay well in the Capitol, what do you think of his mind?' Wouldn't you know, 'Sometimes I thought there was something strange', he said. 

STEPAN:
Is that true?

KRILLOV:
You have no right to drag me into this. That was long ago and I did not give my whole opinion.  Leave me out of this scandal!

[Liputin threw up his hands in innocence.]

LIPUTIN: 
Scandal-monger! Why not say I'm a spy?  Even the drunk Captain Lebyadkin thinks he's mad, 'He's a subtle serpent', he said, 'and he may be clever but he's mad.'

STEPAN:
How could Lebyadkin know?

LIPUTIN: 
Mr. Krillov can explain....

KRILLOV:
I hardly know anything! You made Lebyadkin drunk for information. And now its clear you brought me here to make me say Nikolay is mad.  

LIPUTIN:
On the contrary, the broke Captail Lebyadkin has quite some money these days and treated me to champagne.  But maybe I will make him drunk one day to find out what you're hiding!

[Stepan grows bewildered at the two disputants]

Krillov knows Nikolay but conceals it. And he knew Captain Lebyadkin before any of us, since six years ago in the Capitol, in that obscure epoch in the life of our prince. Nikolay, it seems, surrounded himself with a queer selection of acquaintances, including Mr. Krillov.

KRILLOV:
I warn you, Nikolay is meant to be in town before long, and he knows how to defend himself.

LIPUTIN:
Why warn me?  I am the first to say he is a man of refined intelligence. Why, but even this lame and mad Mademoiselle Lebyadkin who is thrashed daily seems to be a victim of Nicolay.  Captain Lebyadkin suggested it himself.  And stop crying about slander and spying, the whole town is ringing with it!

STEPAN:
The whole town's ringing with what?

LIPUTIN: (about Lebyadkin)
Captain Lebyadkin is shouting all over town that it's Nikolay who's sending money to the drunk Captain to keep quiet, but its not working anymore.

[Krillov gets up suddenly from his chair]

KRILLOV:
This is vile!

LIPUTIN:
You yourself confirmed it.

KRILLOV:
There's been a misunderstanding.

LIPUTIN:
A mad girl mixed up with the estranged town prince. I think we can understand Ms. Petrovna's concern.  For that matter you should be concerned too, it's nothing for Nikolay to cover his own sins by throwing shame on an honorable man.  I know it myself four years ago when Nikolay groped my wife in front of the whole town.

STEPAN:
Be careful, Liputin.

[Stepan grows pale but stands up]

KRILLOV:
Lebyadkin's drunk and there's been a mistake, it will all be explained.

[exit Krillov]

LIPUTIN:
What? I'm going with you!

[exit Liputin]

[exit Stepan slowly with hat and stick]
